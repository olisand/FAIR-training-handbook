Description This chapter will explain why it is important to add attributions to your training material. We will define the roles of author, trainers and contributor and ways of how to attribute credit to them in the contact of training material. It will also discuss of how you can encourage others to contribute to your material. Learning Outcomes Recognise the importance of attribution Explain why it is important to encourage continous contributions and acknowledgements Define the difference between author, trainer and contributor Define criteria for acknowledgements Describe roles for credit attribution as an additional way of credit attribution Describe ways to engage communities (trainers and trainees) to get contributions and feedback Use persistent identifiers for people in the context of attribution Describe how to capture contributors and authors depending on the repository / platform Provide credit for other training material Importance of attribution of credit Attributing credit is as important for training material as it is for scientific literature. While in the scientific literature authors and co-authors are listed, the following roles play an important part in the context of training material. Author Teacher / trainer Contributor We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition. In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors. Exercise Potential learning experience: Search for training material online and analyse how credit is attributed and to whom. (in groups, 10 mins, 5 min search, 5 min wrap-up) Different roles Each author is expected to: Have made substantial contributions to at least one of the following: a. conception or design b. creation of exercises c. creation of lectures d. creation of the learner\u2019s environment e. drafting/revision Have approved the course version Be personally accountable for their contributions Each teacher / trainer is expected to have had interactions with learners during the respective course version as part of a didactic process. Each contributor has contributed to the course material including, but not limited to: Improvement of exercises and lectures Testing and evaluation of exercises/lectures/learner\u2019s environment Everyone who does not meet authorship, contributor or trainer criteria but deserve so should be acknowledged. For example, persons or organisations should be attributed if their course material was used as base or inspiration for the current course material version. Ideally this should be in the form of a citation. Note Minimum information for citations: Author, year, material title, version, DOI To eliminate name confusion and ensure appropriate attribution to the authors and teachers, it is highly recommended to adapt ORCID iDs. Where to list them? Authors On the course website main page, including ORCiD. In the README.md in the github repository. In the .zenodo.json file Any other appropriate metadata file Teachers On the course website main page, including ORCiD. Contributors In the case of a repository: automatic contributor of the repository. Otherwise, where appropriate (see below at Acknowledgment/citation ) Acknowledgement / Citation Where appropriate: - At the course website main page for general acknowledgement (e.g. \u2018this course was inspired by \u2026\u2019) - At the appropriate presentation slide - At the appropriate course page Importance to encourage contribution It is important to encourage contribution to training material as this will allow for the training content to develop over time, and thus to be kept updated. In addition potential mistakes can be identified and corrected. And the quality of the material will increase with more contributions. Acknowledging contributions serves as a motivation for people to contribute and will drive the formation of a community of interest. Credit matrix It is more and more common in scientific literature to use a matrix for clarifying contributions to a publication. Such a matrix provides a standardised list of contributor roles and allows to assign authors to these roles. One example of such a matrix is the CRediT matrix. The CRediT matrix was reworked for the purpose of training material and is provided below. It should become best practice to use such a matrix also for training materials. The CRediT matrix can be helpful in evaluating whether a person is an author or contributor. Usually an author has made a significant contribution to one or more roles in the CRediT matrix. Related to this, it can be used to describe the actual responsibilities of the different authors. CRediT role Relevance training Interpretation in training context Conceptualization Yes Concept of the course. E.g. defining the need Data curation Limited Formal Analysis Limited Funding acquisition Yes Acquisition of funds for the course Investigation Limited Methodology Yes Defining course format/exercise ideas. Project administration Yes Management and coordination Resources Yes E.g. computing resources Software Yes Software and code required for exercises and/or generation of course material Supervision Yes Leadership responsibilities for the course Validation Limited Visualization Limited/Yes Writing \u2013 original draft Yes Actual generation of final course material Writing \u2013 review & editing Yes Evaluation and testing of course material Learning experience How useful do you think the matrix is and which roles still need to be adapted for training material?
